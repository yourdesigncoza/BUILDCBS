## History

Founded in 1997, The Outdoor Deck Company has close to three decades of experience in the outdoor design market both in the UK and abroad.

As one of the first decking companies in the market, The Outdoor Deck Company quickly gained a reputation for the quality of workmanship and knowledge of timber solutions. The demand from the commercial sector grew and in 1999, we installed the largest timber deck in Europe.

The Outdoor Deck Company is now the go-to partner for commercial & high-end residential outdoor projects. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
